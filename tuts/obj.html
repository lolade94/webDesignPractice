               DOM CONCEPT
----------------------------------------
From a JavaScript perspective, the Document 
Object Model uses JavaScript objects to 
represent the various parts that make up a 
Web page. For example, a whole Web page is
represented by a Document object, while
elements within the page — body, h1, p, and so
on — are represented by Element objects. The page 
elements are represented as a tree, with
the Document object at the top.-->
