Hotline Bling” is most likely about Drake’s old flame from Toronto, Nebby. She’s had an on and off relationship with the 6 God a few times, and her Instagram account is a constant reminder that she’s never home – always traveling to exotic places, and out wearing almost nothing. Based on the lyrics, it’s as if Drake wrote this song while scrolling through her Instagram page.

This song premiered  alongside “Charged Up,” “Right Hand,” and material from other OVO artists on OVO Sound Radio Episode 2.

It reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Drake’s highest peaking single (as a lead artist) since his breakthrough hit “Best I Ever Had” hit number 2. The song heavily samples the song “Why Can’t We Live Together” by Timmy Thomas and has been remixed/covered by a seemingly ever-growing number of Drake’s peers, including Justin Bieber, Erykah Badu, Disclosure/Sam Smith, and Sufjan Stevens.

The official music video was released on October 19th via Apple Music, and was immediately made into a source of various memes involving Drake’s dancing.
